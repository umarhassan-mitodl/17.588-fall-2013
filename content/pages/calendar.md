"\[G\]overnments differ in kind, as will be evident to anyone who considers the matter according to the method that has guided us so far. As in other departments of science, so in politics, the compound should always be disaggregated into the simplest elements, or essential parts, of the whole. We must therefore look at the elements of which the state is composed, in order to see how the different kinds of rule differ from one another and whether any scientific result can be attained about each one of them." (Aristotle, _The Politics_, Book 1, Part 1).

"So great is the force of laws, and of particular forms of government, and so little dependence have they of the humors and tempers of men, that consequences almost as general and certain may sometimes be deduced from them as any which mathematical sciences afford us." (David Hume, "That Politics May be Reduced to a Science," Essay III in _Essays: Moral,_ _Political and Literary_).
